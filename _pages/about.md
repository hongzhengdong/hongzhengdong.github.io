I'm a fourth-year PhD student from [College of Computer Science](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Guofeng Zhang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/gfzhang/). Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree from the School of Electrical Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), where I get a deep understanding of analog circuit design and embedded system design, and won the championship in 8th Texas Instrument (TI) Electronic Design Competition (Ranking: 1/1847, Highest Award).

I'm passionate about Robotics. My research lies in the areas of robotic dexterous manipulation, world model and robot system design. Additionally, I am interested in the creation of lifelike robotic simulation environments and the transfer of robot policies, trained in these simulation contexts, to real-world hardware.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) of Su Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) from 2023 to 2024, where I was a research scholar and a junior specialist. I built 3 complete robotic systems for Su Lab (including hardware, control and simulation), and successfully lead 2 firt-author projects which have been published (IROS 2024) or presented at (RSS 2025) robot conferences.
